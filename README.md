# Sorting Algorithm Comparison using C++ with Raylib and Multithreading

## Overview
This project provides a visual comparison of different sorting algorithms using **C++**, **Raylib** for graphics rendering, and **multithreading** to optimize performance. The goal is to demonstrate the efficiency and behavior of various sorting techniques through real-time visualization.

## Features
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Compare different sorting techniques side by side.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Uses Raylib to render sorting progress frame by frame.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes concurrency to speed up sorting and rendering.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

## Technologies Used
- **C++** (Core Logic)
- **Raylib** (Graphics and Visualization)
- **Threads** (C++ Standard Library for Multithreading)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **C++ Compiler** (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- **Raylib** (Install from https://www.raylib.com/)

### Compilation
```sh
mingw32-make
```
OR
```sh
make
```

### Running the Program
```sh
 ./sorting_visualizer
```

## Usage
- Run the executable to start the visualization.
- Select sorting algorithms to compare.
- Adjust array size and speed for better analysis.
- Observe the performance differences in real-time.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms (Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, etc.).
- Enhance UI with better controls and customization.
- Optimize multithreading for smoother rendering.
